## Interview Samples

This repo contains samples and snippets I've written for various interviews.  It's organized by language and source, with
individual problems or packages broken out from there.  Note:  I've built and submitted these independently, haven't done so from this repo.

Each subject contains a brief description (SCENARIO.md, PROBLEM*.txt). My notes, when present, are found in SOLUTION*.txt.
