Perl version:  5.20

Running:  
	perl .\src\main\perl\FindSLCSPByZip.pl

This looks for input files in the current dir by default, overridden by the following full-path env vars, if present:
    SLCSP_GEO_INFO      -> ${wherever}/zips.csv
    SLCSP_PLAN_INFO     -> ${wherever}/plans.csv
    SLCSP_SEARCH_ZIPS   -> ${wherever}/slcsp.csv

It logs to stderr, enabled by instance (global for perl) vars.

My general approach is to match zip -> state, area -> rate lists, using the contents of slcsp.csv to filter the zips file on import.

Perl notes:
  --stderr logging is enabled by 5 vars, defined at the top of the program.
  --Uses printf formatting to round off the floats.
