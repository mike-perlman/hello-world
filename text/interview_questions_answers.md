
### What IDE do you use and why?
Primarily, Eclipse (Java, C).   For languages like Perl and Ruby, and any tinkering through a shell, I'll use a text editor (vim, notepad++).  Recently, I've started playing with Dart, which involves IntelliJ, and R, which uses R-Studio, based on Eclipse.


### What challenges do you foresee as a remote programmer and how do you intend to address them?
Having been remote for most of my career...

1) Connectivity.  Comms redundancy (1 cell, 1 Fiber, 1 DSL).
2) Environment control:  short-term (noise/temp), long-term (stagnation).  Workspace redundancy (in and out of home).  
3) Coordination (shared between remote and remote teams) - Match the method(s) to the purpose. Use synchronous methods (e.g. Phone/video) for Q&A and broadcast purposes.  Use asynchronous (chats/emails/forums) for goals which require persistence, combine the two as needed (e.g. troubleshooting, pairing, etc.)


### Explain what version control is as if you were speaking with a non-programmer professional. Then explain your version control system of choice, including its successes and its drawbacks.

"Imagine using a computer which 
 - stores a new copy for each file save action...
 - lets you choose from your previous saves if you don't want to load your current work (or have deleted it)...
 - lets you and your coworkers merge edits of each of your own copies of a file, into a new copy accessible to all of you.
 - provides a numbering scheme so that each copy is uniquely identified.
 - can show a historical view of its files as of a given date, and generate copies of them."
 
 As far as favorites go... Historically, Intersolv's PVCS was a good one.  The UI was clunky, but it did maintain good separation, as we had several patch and release in QA simultaneously.  In corporate, version control was always paid products, for the service/support.  I'm starting to use Git due to its popularity.
 
 
### Describe a situation on which you have experienced significant project change that you werenâ€™t expecting. Be sure to explain its impact and how you adapted to the change. How did you remain productive through the project?

I've had projects deprioritize based on changing business need; my response there was to archive work (notes, code, designs) done up to that point, and fill the freed-up bandwidth with my other projects and support work.

Also, I've had new project assignments suddenly appear via prioritization. In that case, a map out the various features to be delivered, find the delivery conflicts, and sync up the PMs and managers involved.  In the event I get to decide the resulting order, prioritize stability and dollar impact over other aspects.
