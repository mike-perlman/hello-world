Scenario:
You’ve been asked by your client, a municipality, to put their dog license application form online. What questions do you ask?

Submission
List the questions, keep it under 600 words, and store as a plain text file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

1)  What application volume do they see (new apps and updates)?

2)  What hours should this application be available (if not 24/7)?

3a)  What does today's application workflow look like?
3b)  Are there any internal steps (validations, etc) which need to be tracked
internally and/or reported to applicants? 
3c)  Do filed applications wait in some form of queue or pile today?
3d)  What is the expected turnaround time on an application, from initial
filing to accept/reject decision?

4)  What roles and responsibilities are involved in the workflow?  I'm looking for some form of Reviewers / Approvers / Researchers / Admins / Managers breakdown.

5)  How are the filed applications and licenses stored and retrieved today? (Paper or a backend system)?

6)  What types of contact info (phone / sms / soc-media / email / mail / etc) are recorded?

7)  What kinds of notifications (renewal reminder, expiry notice, accept/reject notice) should applicants receive?

8a)  How long should a resident's contact info remain on file?
8b)  Same question, for a dog's info.

9)  Are they producing any reports from the applications, and if so, what info
and time periods are reported on?
